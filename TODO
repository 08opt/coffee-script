TODO:

* Finish the examples.

* Write a test suite that checks the JS evaluation.

* Figure out a generic way to transform statements into expressions, and
  use it recursively for returns and assigns on whiles, fors, ifs, etc.
  
* If we manage to get array comprehensions working ... object comprehensions?

* Create the documentation page. (amy, idle)
  uv -c . -s coffeescript -t amy --no-lines examples/code.cs > code.html

* Is it possible to close blocks (functions, ifs, trys) without an explicit
  block delimiter or significant whitespace?
  
* Is it possible to pass comments through cleanly and have them show up on
  the other end? This includes comments in the middle of array and object
  literals, and argument lists.
