TODO:

* Add TextMate syntax highlighter to the download.

* Code Cleanup.

* Add JS-style exponential number literals.

* Is it possible to close blocks (functions, ifs, trys) without an explicit
  block delimiter or significant whitespace?
  
* Is it possible to pass comments through cleanly and have them show up on
  the other end? This includes comments in the middle of array and object
  literals, and argument lists.
